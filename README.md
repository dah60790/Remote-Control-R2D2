# Remote-Control-R2D2
A Robotic R2D2 machine that can be controlled wirelessly using a raspberry Pi and connecting to it through putty
Our Project was to take an R2D2 bubble machine and add wheels and motors that can be controlled wirelessly through a raspberry pi. 

The Raspberry Pi can be accessed using any devise that can connect through SSH.
Us use both putty and VCN viewer.

There was three main components that we bought for this project. 
1) For the bubble machine if you type "r2d2 bubble machine" on amazon you should find the right machine.
2) IF you type in either "arduino car kit" or "raspberry pi car kit" on amazon you should find what youâ€™re looking for.
3) we used a raspberry pi so was used a "RasPiRobot Board v3" which we also bought on amazon. This is a motor shelled.
Of course there is also a few other odds and ends such as screws, extra wires for connecting and tools needed to cut or drill into R2D2.

With the RasPiRobot Board v3 we found a library to show what code we needed to use in order to run our motors.
